This repository consists of 3 models:
- An **autoencoder** to map scRNA-seq data to and from a 50 dimensional latent space
- A **Flow-matching** model to generate artificial sc-RNAseq data
- A **Classifier-Free-Guidance** model to generate artificial sc-RNAseq data conditioned on cell-type

The repository contains jupyter notebooks for training and evaluation of each model, as well as a general notebook showcasing the main results of the model (evaluation/Isoflow_main.ipynb).
